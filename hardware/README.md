# Eduquencer pcb schematic and design

## TODO

### Path to PCB prototype
- [ ] Finish the schematic
  - [x] Wire up rpi
  - [x] Add circuits for clock and reset
  - [x] Add debug header for flashing the rpi
  - [x] Add all the trigger jacks (+circuit around them, there might be some more resistors needed?)
  - [x] Add test-points for all i2c and SPI
  - [ ] Check all GND in analog parts and change to GNDA (cv-in?)
  - [ ] Add LED circuits for CV in (op-amps)
  - [ ] Adjust DAC opamp resistor for proper range (+add DAC out jack)
- [ ] Annotate all parts
- [ ] Assign footprints (all footprints should be the kicad handsolder ones)
- [ ] Preliminary layout with all components (only footprint placement)
- [ ] Decide on a name
- [ ] Decide which jacks to use
- [ ] Do the final layout

### LEDs
- MCP capabilities: 25mA sink per pin, 400mA total
- RPI capabilities: 3V3 is the main 3.3V supply to RP2040 and its I/O, generated by the on-board SMPS. This pin can be used to power external circuitry (maximum output current will depend on RP2040 load and VSYS voltage, it is recommended to keep the load on this pin less than 300mA).
- Step/channel LEDs:
  - Green: XZDGK45WT-9; 1.4mA@560Ω@3v3
  - Red: XZM2CRK45WT-9; 6.3mA@220Ω@3v3
